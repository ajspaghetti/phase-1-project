POKEMON! Flatiron Version

App Purpose:
- Build your personal -*~/*Shiny*~\*- Pokemon Team to prepare for battle in the wilds of Kanto!
- This app is to help end-users familiarize themselves with first-generation Pokemon.
    - Users can learn about:
        - Pokemon Names
        - Pokemon Forms
        - Pokedex order
        - Pokemon types
- Pick your desired Trainer, then you can select 6 Pokemon to join you from the provided selection of 151!

App Utilization:
- There are 3 main steps to build your team:

    1. Select your trainer from the three options: #CLICK    
        - Male
        - Non-binary
        - Female

    2. Select your team of Shiny Pokemon:
        - You can choose Shiny Variants from the original 151 Pokemon from the Nintedo/Gamefreak FireRed and LeafGreen Versions, which were re-releases from 2003 based on the original 1996 Pokemon Red, Blue, and Green Versions.
        - Click "ADD" in the Yellow Box above each Pokemon. Once clicked, the Pokemon will appear, in order of when-clicked, in the Pokeball icons to the right of the Trainer you selected. #CLICK
        - You can click on each Pokemon in the poke-container field to flip them from front-facing to back-facing to learn more about each Pokemon's anatomy! #CLICK
        - You are limited to 6 Pokemon to your team, just like in the original Pokemon games! If you try to select past 6, you will receive an error message at the top of your browser. #ALERT.

    3. Once your team is selected, click "GO!" The app will then auto-play the Wild Pokemon Battle Theme music from the Original Pokemon Red, Blue, and Green Versions!
        - If at any point you are unhappy with your Pokemon selections, or you want to stop the music and re-build a team, click on the "reset" button below "GO!" and you will be able to refresh the team-bar without needing to refresh the page. #CLICK
        - Confetti will appear on the screen after a 1s delay thanks to code found online!

Further information:
- The individual Pokemon Sprites, Names, and Types are all pulled from the POKE-API. They auto-populate into the poke-container and then integrate themselves into the general website
- The music that plays was ripped from YouTube, then added to the Project Folder with the index.js file which then accesses it locally.
- The Rest of the data and images on the site are coded in via HTML and CSS.
- In the DOM, you can see more of the Pokemon's information pulled from POKE-API
